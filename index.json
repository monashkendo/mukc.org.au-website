[{"content":"About Kendo  The concept of kendo is to discipline the human character through the principles of the katana.\n ~ The All Japan Kendo Federation\nKendo (剣道), \u0026ldquo;The Way of The Sword\u0026rdquo;, is a traditional Japanese martial art, descending from kenjutsu (Japanese swordsmanship).\nIn Kendo, practitioners wear bogu (armour) and use shinai (bamboo swords) to strike one another while performing specialised footwork and kiai (shout). Practitioners test their skills against each other in matches called shiai. The contest of skills with an opponent gives kendo an athletic aspect which draws many to the art. However, the main focus of kendo is on the the philosophical aspects of discipline and the cultivation of the mind, body and spirit through continued keiko (practice).\nAbout MUKC We are Monash University Kendo Club, also known as MUKC. We are a Monash University Sports club, and are predominantly student-run with guidance from qualified instructors.
